# Pademelon

A desktop manager for modular Linux desktop setups.

## What does this do?
Pademelon ties together different software and tools to get a working desktop out of the box.
It aims to be completely modular, so you can swap out everything as you go.
Still one important goal of this software is to provide a desktop that works out of the box - especially with window managers like DWM or i3.
